# Calculator-Infinity

This is a simple calculator with beautiful UI which can perform basic Arithmetic Operations like Addition, Multiplication, 
Division & Subtraction.
Currently it can perform calculations for two operands only. Thus, BODMAS rule is not applicable here.
The UI is Simple & hassle-free.

Changes regarding all these are most welcome.
